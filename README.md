# simple-calculator
simple calculator having basic add, sub, multi, div, mod, sqrt, power, cube root.

# How I done this
I defined function for every operation like addition, subtraction, etc.
In the function I wrote the simple formulas like for addition we do a+b and so on.
Then I used 'print' statement to execute every operation.

# Future Improvements
I will try to make it more short program using if-else, choices and well defined function for calculator.
Which will easy to use in more efficient way for the user.
In the next version, I will also add feature of saving the history past calculations.
